ClusterFuzz tools
=================================

Status: Early prototype phase

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/google/clusterfuzz-tools/tree/master.svg?style=shield)](https://circleci.com/gh/google/clusterfuzz-tools/tree/master)
[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/google/clusterfuzz-tools/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/google/clusterfuzz-tools?branch=master)

The tools supports various tasks (e.g. reproduce a crash locally)
needed by ClusterFuzz's users.

Currently, it supports reproducing a crash locally. In the future, it will
support uploading a fuzzer, tailing fuzzer log, and uploading a testcase.


Requirements
---------------

* [gsutil](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil_install)
* `blackbox` and `xdotool`; these can be installed with `apt-get`.


Installation
-----------------

ClusterFuzz tools is a single binary file built with [Pex](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex).
Therefore, you can simply copy the binary and run it.


For Goobuntu:

1. Run `prodaccess`.
2. Run `/google/data/ro/teams/clusterfuzz-tools/releases/clusterfuzz reproduce -h`.

For others:

1. Download [the latest stable version](https://storage.cloud.google.com/clusterfuzz-tools).
2. Run `clusterfuzz-<version>.pex reproduce -h`.


Usage
------

See `<binary> reproduce --help`. Run `<binary> reproduce [testcase-id]`.

Here's the workflow (we think) might be appropriate when fixing a bug:

1. Run `<binary> reproduce [testcase-id]`.
2. Make a new branch and make a code change.
3. Run against the code change with `<binary> reproduce [testcase-id] --current`.
4. If the crash doesnâ€™t occur anymore, it means your code change fixes the crash.
